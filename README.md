**README**

Have you ever wondered if you could just type your github or linkedin username/id in the field, and will automatically fill the rest of url link.

For example if I type medev21 for my github in the field, after pressing enter, I should see this in the field ->

https://github.com/medev21

This is just small project of mine to see if I can improve user experience.

The page was done with -> HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript

Please let me know if you have suggestions or comments.
